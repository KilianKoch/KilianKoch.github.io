            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Kilian Koch, a mathematician and software developer. I
              have a master's degree in mathematics with a minor in Computer
              Science Applications. My main focus is on Applied Analysis and
              Mathematical Physics.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
              In mathematics I work on gradient flow analysis, in particular on
              well-posedness and singular behaviour, e.g. due
              to topological constraints, such as the harmonic map heat flow. In
              software, I develop practical solutions to real-world problems,
              such as business workflow automation and customer data management.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through my experience of working directly with customers at
              various events and managing information, I have developed strong
              customer communication skills. The combination of maths and
              software development gives me excellent problem solving skills.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p>
              Outside of work, I enjoy calisthenics, weight training, and
              boxing.
